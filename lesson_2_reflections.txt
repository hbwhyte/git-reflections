What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When you run "git init" you are able to create a git repository so in the
    future you can track changes for new or existing files in that directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a middle ground which is good to separate out smaller
    actions, and to bundle changes, before permanently making them part of the
    git record by adding them to the commit log.
